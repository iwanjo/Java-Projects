# Java-Projects

Hey There, I am Ian Wanjohi, an aspiring software developer and designer at the African Leadership University in Rwanda. Welcome to my Java Projects Repo, where I am showcasing the various design and solution based projects I have made with Java. Feel free to have a look around, and if you find some code enticing, grab it at your own will!
