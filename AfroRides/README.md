Project Configuration

For this project we are using JavaFX Library and JDK 8. We used JDK 8 because it was more convenient in creating the runnable jar files, as compared to the above versions. In our project, we have made sure to include the sample package, so it should run on your machine. Furthermore, in IntelliJ, the jar file, is located in out/artifacts/JavaFXApp/JavaFXApp.Jar. This should be easy to identify.

I have included an extra img file, these are just for the screenshots of our GUI Application.

Project Description

Our application is called AfroRides, and will allow the user to conveniently book a taxi to their required destination. In our Graphical Application, the user will be presented with a welcome message, and then be given two options, to go to the registration screen or book their taxi. It is optional to register, and if they do, they will be asked for their personal details and be able to proceed to the next screen where they will be able to book their taxi.

Once the user chooses their preferred type of taxi, they will be asked to enter their current and destination locations from dropdowns. Once they hit confirm, the user will be taken to their destination and the application will end.

Along the application, we have made it conveniently simple for the user to return to the home screen(The First Scene).
